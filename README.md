# Molinari-TBC

This AddOn is a Backport of the AddOn [Molinari](https://github.com/p3lim-wow/Molinari) for TBC

## Description

Molinari was made to aid the player in processing various items throughout the game.  
As an example:  
> if you want to prospect ores, you would normally cast [Prospecting](http://wowhead.com/spell=31252) and then click the item in your bags.  
With Molinari, you simply hold down the `Alt` key and click the item directly.

The following spells/processes are supported:

- [Prospecting](http://wowhead.com/spell=31252)
- [Disenchanting](http://wowhead.com/spell=13262)
- [Lockpicking](http://wowhead.com/spell=1804) & [skeleton keys](http://wowhead.com/items?filter=na=key;cr=86;crs=2)

In addition, Molinari also works for lockpicking in the trade window.
